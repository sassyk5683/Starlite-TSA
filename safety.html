    <h1>Safety We Provide</h1>
    <p>Going into space is a very dangerous which is why Starlite makes safety its #1 priority. We want what is best for the astronauts, which is a smooth and safe trip to and from space. We have a very well trained management team and manufacturing team that covers all the safety needs on the company’s end. Starlite also has mandatory waivers and more, that astronauts have to sign and turn in before operating any machinery and participating in company activities.</p>

    <h2>Management Team</h2>
    <p>The management team makes sure that the astronauts have a safe launch and recovery. They take quick and thought out decisions while using communication with the crew. If any troubles or complications happen in space, the management team will work out ways to overcome it. They are mostly located in the Starlite facility but also have their own workspace on Starlite's land (for launch). Any waivers, paperwork, and legal documents are handled and dealt with by the management team.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Team</h2>
    <p>The manufacturing team makes sure that all of Starlite’s spaceships are ready and up to date to go into space. They build all of Starlite's vechiles and more. They make sure that while building, everything is strictly thought out and all calculations are accurate. After each expedition, the team does a maintenance check up to ensure that everything in the space vehicle is working properly and is ready for its next mission.</p>
