    <h2>What is an Astronaut &amp; How Do I Become One?</h2>
    <p>An astronaut is someone who travels up to space to discover the unknown and beyond. They use various equipment to perform tasks which includes space ships, space suits, and more. They also bring back findings back to Earth so scientest can study more on them and gain information. Here at Starlite we provide tools and more so you can start your astronaut journey. When you have made up your mind <a href="aboutus.html">contact us</a> and we will put you to the stars and beyond!</p>
    
    <p>To start your astronaut journey you need to make sure you are mentally and physically ready. Space has many different effects on the human body and to ensure you are ready you need to get certified. Luckily, here at Starlite we have a training facility that provides classes and simulations that help. Learn more <a href="training.html">here</a>!</p>
        
    <p>While getting started on your space journey, Starlite wants to make sure that you feel safe and comfortable. We have enacted rules to make sure things go by smoothly and you are getting the best, and safe, experience. To review the terms and conditions, click <a href="safety.html">here</a>!</p>
        
    <p>Getting to know the vehicles that Starlite provides is very important. They will be the vehicles you will be using while going on expeditions and exploring space. Learn more about them by clicking <a href="vehicles.html">here!</a></p>

    <h2>About Expeditions</h2>
    <p>The goal of each expedition is to get new information and study on it. Astronauts travel to each expedition in a Starlite vehicle which is fully equiped with tools to help while discovering. There are different expeditions that are depended on your level, skill, and knowledge over everything. Expeditions WILL and can be repeated until further instructed by the Starlite team to ensure you are getting experience and accurate information. "Star Groups" are groups of Starlite astronaunts that work together on expeditions. When in a "Star Group", each astronaut is payed their set salary (there are no added beniefts). Starlite also covers all damages and malfunctions of each space vehicle in expeditions. All astronauts are required to record and return findings on each expedition.</p>

  <h2>Launch</h2>
      <p>Starlite has it's own property for space activites like the launching of space vehicles. There is a lot of acres to cover (that will be built more on when expansion happens) that locates the launchpads. When set up, astronaunts will go to the launchpad and enter the space vechicle that will get launched into space. Crew members and more will be there when the site is active. A decent amount of the land is open to the public to see the takeoff but also requires a fee of $50 (plus tax).</p>

  <div class="recovery">
  <h2>Recovery</h2>
    <p>When expeditions have ended, there is a set location on the ocean that astronauts and cargo will land. Starlite crew members take many ships from the dock, and travel to the location. Astronauts and cargo will be attached to parachutes and guided by Starlite crew for a smooth and safe recovery. Once astronaut(s) and/or cargo is retrieved, the boat goes back to the docks and items are in safe keeping at the Starlite facility.</p>
