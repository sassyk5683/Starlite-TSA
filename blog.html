                <h2>Tracy Smith</h2>
                <p>"Hi! I’m Tracy Smith and I've been an astronaut at Starlite for 4 years. My most memorable adventure was when I started out on the Kayis ship and I was on a mission to find a new space rock. My "Star Group" and I were orbiting around Earth but just a little further than normal, and we ended up near a meteor shower. Luckily Kayis had all the right technologies and tools to help us push through it and even discover some cool rocks. It was the most beautiful and unique experience I've ever had!" - Tracy Smith, 2023 Starlite Interview</p>

                <h2>Kingston Folger</h2>
                <p>"Hello, I'm Kingston Folger and I’m pretty new to being an astronaut. I first started by going through Starlite's training system where I learned the basics and trained my body for whats to come. After I got certified, I got to go on a few missions and had a pretty fun time. My first big mission, I went on Starlite's Sparta X and it was a breeze. I was on an expedition to extract a new plant species on Mars. At first I was having trouble, but with the help of the amazing crew and management team, and the cool technology on the ship, I was able to have a smooth landing on Mars and just as smooth all the way back to Earth." - Kingston Folger, 2023 Starlite Interview</p>
